# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction System

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application developed for the **Advanced Python** course. It predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters using a trained classification model.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed data analysis and visualization using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Data preprocessing, scaling, and model training phases.
- **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly web interface built with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
- **Model Persistence:** Pre-trained model (`.pkl`) and scaler are used for consistent results.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit
- **Data:** Heart Disease Dataset (CSV)
